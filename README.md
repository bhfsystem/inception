Builds
======

Only on OSX, bring up a limbo to host the dreams:

    runmany 'dream $1' media build export rebuild

Then on Ubuntu or OSX, build the dreams:

    reality update
    runmany 'reality dream $1' media build export rebuild

Then the various limbos can come up with their dreams:

    runmany '$1 up; $1 update; $1 dream import' van hotel fortress
