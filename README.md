Builds
======

Only on OSX, bring up a dream first:

    runmany 'dream $1' media build export rebuild update

Then on Ubuntu or OSX, build the containers:

    runmany 'reality dream $1' media build export rebuild

Then the various incept dreams can come up with containers:

    runmany '$1 up; $1 update; $1 import' van hotel fortress
